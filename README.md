# ECG Heartbeat Categorization

## Overview

#### What is an ECG?
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity.

Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.

These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor to see if they're unusual.

An ECG may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your heart, including your GP. That's the result of this test we will analyze.

## Objective
The aims of this project to be able to classify heart disease from heartbeat signal.
## About Dataset
[PTB Diagnostic ECG Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)

### Abstract
This dataset is composed of two collections of heartbeat signals derived from two famous datasets in heartbeat classification, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The number of samples in both collections is large enough for training a deep neural network.

This dataset has been used in exploring heartbeat classification using deep neural network architectures, and observing some of the capabilities of transfer learning on it. The signals correspond to electrocardiogram (ECG) shapes of heartbeats for the normal case and the cases affected by different arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. These signals are preprocessed and segmented, with each segment corresponding to a heartbeat.

### Random Forest Classifier

```python
#Random forest classifier
rforest = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=123)
rforest.fit(X_train, y_train)

train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, rforest.predict(X_train))
test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, rforest.predict(X_test))

print("Random Forest Classifier \n Train Acc : {} \n Test Acc : {}\n".format(train_acc,test_acc))
print("Confusion Matric Test: \n", confusion_matrix(y_test, rforest.predict(X_test)))
print("Classification Report Test : \n",classification_report(y_test, rforest.predict(X_test)))
print("Overall Precision:",precision_score(y_test, rforest.predict(X_test)))
print("Overall Recall:",recall_score(y_test, rforest.predict(X_test)))
```
